# Jumpy-Run

### Endless runner made for the 2019 Mighty Kingdom grad test


You're running late for a party and traffic is all backed up, so the only logical thing to do is parkour your way there. 

You also forgot to buy drinks, so pickup the magical floating ones on the way

Swipe up to jump accross gaps and obstacles while swiping down to slide under billboards. Arrow keys also works if playing on PC.
